# RecipeFinder
A simple and elegant Recipe Finder application built using React.js. Users can search for recipes (e.g., chicken, pasta, pizza) and view recipe details through a clean UI styled with a warm fenugreek color palette.  This project was created as part of my React UI development practice.
